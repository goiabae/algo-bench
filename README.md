# Analise de Algoritmos
## Building
To build `algo-bench`, simply make all into the main directory:
``` sh
$ cd algo-bench
$ make all
```
NOTE: Keep in note that you may have to change compiler used inside of the makefile. I do not know how gcc works in Windows
## Contributing
Before making any commit or push to upstream, make sure to clean the directory of any resquicious files first:

``` sh
$ cd algo-bench
$ cd make clean
```
